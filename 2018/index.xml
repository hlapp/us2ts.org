      <description>As a symposium, the focus of US2TS will be on discussions and community building, and thus there is no paper track. However, everybody is invited and encouraged to bring an A1-sized poster to the poster reception. Please indicate during the registration whether you plan on bringing a poster as space is limited.</description>
