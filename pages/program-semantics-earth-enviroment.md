#### Abstract
This panel session will provide an exposition of semantic techniques for data integration and harmonization that have been employed in the earth and environmental sciences, but are general in nature and may be employed across a range of domains. Panel members (prominent contributors and members of ESIP, the OBO Foundry, Ontolog Forum, OGC, W3C, etc.) have expertise ranging from earth and environmental science, to molecular ecosystems biology, to architecture, engineering and construction as well as semantic and ontological modelling and methods. The panel will stress production-grade technologies, data semantics and their applications which lay strong emphasis on interoperability. 

#### Motivation & Expected Outcomes 

The integration of data using vocabularies supported by semantic enrichment has a long history, including the problems and advantages of specific and detailed vocabulary definitions compared to shallower but broad definitions. While very specific domain-focused vocabulary are useful they have been largely isolated from other vocabularies and thus hard to broaden. This limits cross-domain integration. Recently ontologies, such as SWEET (Semantic Web for Earth and Environmental Terminology) and EnvO (Environment Ontology), have matured in terms of quality and offer new promising efforts to accommodate both broad and deep conceptualizations which can support real-world applications. Of note is that these ontologies have been complemented by more systematic and mature semantic methods along with supporting semantic technology. Taken together these provide a means of opening data solos made up of heterogeneous vocabularies which in turn makes more tractable the integration of earth and environmental sciences data. 
Recent initial work focused on knowledge reprersentation for cryospheric science provides a first step towards best practices as part of that unification in order to advance and develop best practices for semantic harmonization of vocabularies and their formalization in ontologies. But further work is necessary to develop a more unified and tool supported method for this process. 

A major benefit, we believe, is that a unified approach will allow domain experts and ontology engineers to build ontologies whose validity is grounded and the resulting product(s) are easier to integrate and reuse. 

Examples from recent work (SWEET & SOSA/SSN, SWEET & Landform Reference Ontology (LFRO), SWEET & QUDT, ENVO & SWEET, etc.) will be provided by the panel, starting with an introduction of concepts and practices in support of this vision. 

This panel session aims to connect the data vocabulary community of domain experts with the practicing ontology community in support of real-world applications.
