Registration is now open through the [US2TS 2020 registration website](https://cvent.me/lVEY02).

**Early registration cost is $170 Standard and $60 for Students.** 

**After January 31, costs rise to $300 and $120, respectively.**

Poster display space is free of charge at least until the end of Early Registration, but limited and allocated first-come first-serve. If you intend to present a poster, please indicate so as part of your registration.

We are trying hard to keep costs of attendance low and affordable. If you require travel support to attend, a limited amount of travel support grants may become available for students and early-career professionals in January 2020. Please join the [US2TS announcement list or follow us on Twitter](https://us2ts.org/contact) to ensure you receive timely notice if and when applications are solicited.
