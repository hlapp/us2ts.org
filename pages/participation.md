The US2TS Symposium series is an emerging premier forum for fostering community between academic, industry, and government researchers and practitioners in the US that develop or apply semantic technologies. The interest in semantics has been strengthened by the growing dependence on the Web and the continuously increasing importance of large-scale data sharing, integration, and reuse.  Participants at the US2TS come from disciplines in computer science and engineering, natural sciences, geoscience, biology, library science, biomedical and health care sciences, social sciences and the humanities, and many others. Discussions at the symposium cover core topics such as the Semantic Web, Ontologies, Knowledge Graph, Linked Data and AI on the Web, Privacy and Trust, etc., as well as the intersection of such topics with areas such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Blockchains.

=====================================

At this time, we are seeking to understand the interests and motivations of prospective participants, who are already planning or are considering to attend the 3rd US2TS.

We would appreciate if you could fill out the above form to help us gather additional information to structure a productive yet distinct program for this symposium. 

There is no commitment for you to fill this form out. Even if there is only a small chance that you would be attending this year, we would request you to fill out the form. The data that is collected is going to be used only to inform how the program should be organized. We will maintain the results private. Name, organization and email is optional. If you do fill it out, we may contact you to follow up on any questions we may have.
