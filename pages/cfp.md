Semantic Web is an inherently multi-disciplinary field. With an ever-growing dependence on the Web and the
continuously increasing importance of large-scale data sharing, integration, and reuse, natural science
researchers, geoscience, biology, library science, health care, the humanities, just to name a few, have
also taken an increasing interest in the Semantic Web. The U.S. Semantic Technologies Symposium (US2TS)
series provide a forum to ease the division between computer science, natural science, and
academia/government/industry.
