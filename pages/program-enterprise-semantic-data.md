#### Abstract
Following the spirit of US2TS to create community between industry, academia and government, in this session, the presenters will share experiences of deploying semantic technology in the real world and lessons learned tailored to academia and government. The goal is to contribute with positive and negative stories and ideas how academia and government can help to improve the adoption. After each presenter describes their experience, we will have a round table discussion with the community.
