Dr. Binil Starly heads the Digital Manufacturing group at the Edward P. Fitts Industrial and Systems Engineering department in North Carolina State University. His laboratory is working on technologies that merge the digital and the physical world towards advancing both discrete and continuous manufacturing processes. His work is supported by the US National Science Foundation, Department of Energy and the Department of Defense. He has received the National Science Foundation CAREER award for research in engineering living tissue systems, the SME Young Manufacturing Engineer and other teaching awards. He started his career at the University of Oklahoma, grew from Assistant Professor to Associate Professor with tenure, spending 7 years with the university. He then worked for NC State University where he has been for the past 6 years and during this time, he was promoted to Full Professor. He currently holds the James. T. Ryan Professorship in recognition for his work on smart manufacturing technologies.

#### **Title**

Building an Open Knowledge Network (OKN) Graph in Product Design & Manufacturing

#### **Abstract**

Try searching for "Precision gear manufacturers in North Carolina that have served aerospace industry" OR search for "Precision Gear 3D models" in any of the online 3D model galleries. None of these search terms retrieve any meaningful results, primarily because we lack tools to index and search through text and 3D model information. Access to 3D models and manufacturing services is severely limited if potential clients cannot find them. Can we leverage the power of machine learning and the broader AI algorithms to create an Open Knowledge Network integrating diverse data sources from millions of publicly available 3D CAD product models, manufacturing textbooks, blogs, videos, web articles, technical articles etc. to answer those two relatively simple queries? This talk will describe activities to the challenge of building a knowledge network graph in design and manufacturing with demo application that showcase how a user might benefit from it.  Current solutions to classify and categorize 3D product model data are heavily dependent on human annotation and manual classification. Searching through 3D models must be multi-modal â€“ how do we jointly search with text, image and 3D model data. Can we learn from global search engines which understand context around the content of a website and not rely simply on text scraping and indexing content? Understand the challenges and involve the technical community to build a Knowledge Graph for design and manufacturing data.
