**News:** The 4th U.S. Semantic Technologies Symposium has been rescheduled for Thursday, September 29, 2022 - Saturday, October 1, 2022.

As part of the rescheduling, the symposium will be part of the Michigan Week of Ontology and Semantic Web.  The Michigan Week of Ontology and Semantic Web featuring the 4th US2TS and the [13th International Conference on Biomedical Ontology (ICBO)](https://icbo-conference.github.io/icbo2022/).  Back to back the events will be held Sunday, September 25, through Saturday, October 1, 2022.

The dates for each conference are:

- **ICBO**: Sunday, September 25, through Wednesday, September 28
- **US2TS**: Thursday, September 29, through Saturday, October 1 Travel between Ann Arbor (for ICBO) and East Lansing (for US2TS) takes about one hour and 15 minutes. Joint activities will be arranged for the collaborative Michigan Week.

Stay tuned for more information later …

Semantic Web is an inherently multi-disciplinary field. The Artificial Intelligence community has contributed much in the way of formal logic and knowledge representation. Similarly, the applied computer science community, along with industry and government agencies, have contributed with application development and testing. With an ever-growing dependence on the web, and the continuously increasing importance of large-scale data sharing, integration, and reuse, natural science researchers, geoscience, biology, library science, health care, the humanities, just to name a few, have also taken an increasing interest in the Semantic Web. Large-scale industrial applications are under way or already deployed.

Yet, the division between computer science, natural science, and academia/government/industry, has a downside. It limits the formation of a coherent national agenda for exploring emerging trends in Semantic Technologies. What is needed are community consolidation and the building of a U.S.-based community research network.

The goal of the U.S. Semantic Technologies Symposium series is to bring together the U.S. Semantic Web community and begin forming such a research network. We achieve this by supporting communication across disciplinary, organizational, and geographical boundaries. The Symposium events provide a forum by which participants can share information and ideas, coordinate ongoing or planned research activities, foster synthesis and new collaborations, develop community standards, and advance their science and education through communication and the sharing of ideas.

To this end, the 2022 Symposium will be an informal gathering with plenty of time for discussion and breakout sessions. We encourage anyone with an interest in the Semantic Web, regardless of field, to attend.
